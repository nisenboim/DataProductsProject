#Summary
This is a description of "Expected MPG" app. It predict the expected MPG (miles per galon) given car's weight and transmission type. At the core of the calculation is a simple linear regression model: 

```{r}
fit <<- lm(formula = mpg ~ am + wt, data = mtcars)
```

Than, given the two parameters, it uses the "predict" function to calculate the prediction. 

#Usage
There are two widgets:

1. A drop down list that lets the user to choose the transmission type
2. A slider that lets the user to choose the car weight

Reactive functions reflect user's choice on the right (main) panel and immediately output the predicted MPG value.

#ENJOY!
